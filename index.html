                        If the man had kids, boys would carry
                        names as Roland or Robert (Moog), and a girl would surely be named Linn, after the machine made
                        famous by Prince in the 80’s. No wonder one of his major achievements is the album Secret Life
                        Of Machines.

                    <p class="vinyl__description">
                        DJ Hell described his musical beginnings in
                        an interview with The European, telling them “I was socialized with German electronic music of
                        the 1960s and 1970s. There were no commercial aspirations; it was all about experimentation.
                        Hell has worked as a DJ since 1978.

                    <p class="vinyl__description">
                        A founding member of noted Motor City
                        institution Underground Resistance, Mills helped build the artist roster and label ideology (as
                        well as much of its back catalog) with partners "Mad" Mike Banks and Robert "Noise" Hood before
                        moving to New York in 1992 to pursue more vigorously his solo and DJ career (with a resident
                        spot at the legendary Limelight and a recording contract with the noted German label Tresor).
                        (Although rumors of bad blood between the early UR crew have been denied by all involved, Mills'
                        decision to split was apparently total, with Banks all but repudiating his involvement with
                        Mills and Mills distancing himself from the continuing political militancy of Banks and the UR
                        organization.)
